Just a sample COVID-19 tracker Flutter app

This is just a sample project I'm working on while learning Flutter. I'm mainly focusing on the web-app. For the COVID-19 data, I'm using the [Coronavirus COVID19 API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10808728/SzS8rjbc).

Try a working web-app [here](https://sherlockdoyle.github.io/covidart/build/web/index.html).
